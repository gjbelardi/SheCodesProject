        After a few years of gradually recording in a friendsâ€™ basement in
        Queens, Gabriela Belardi (also known as Sullenflower) has finally made
        her artist debut with â€œShort Hair." Born and raised in South Salem, NY,
        Gabriela grew up running around the woods, swimming in lakes, and
        exhausting her energy through all things creative. Her father always
        playing guitar in his free time, and her mother an avid writer, she
        slowly came to mold both crafts together, and by the age of ten began
        writing lyrics to melodies in her head. She kept this hobby to herself
        for most of her childhood never considering it very serious, until
        taking a summer songwriting workshop at a local college, SUNY Purchase.
        Here she learned that not only was she very intrigued by songwriting,
        but she wanted to do it for the rest of her life. Gabriela then went on
        to study music at the City College of New York where she received a
        Bachelor of the Arts in Music. While in college she began performing at
        local venues and with friends in Brooklyn and Manhattan. After
        reconnecting with a high school friend, she began to record and form a
        band. Now, with the help of Ian McNally as engineer, her musical
        writings have reached the internet.
